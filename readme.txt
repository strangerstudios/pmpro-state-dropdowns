Existing users that have entered their State/Province before using this add-on may be required to update their profile while PMPro State Dropdowns is activated. This is usually caused by incorrect spelling of the State/Province. (This only affects the front-end of your site and won't affect the previously saved user meta)

Not all countries may be fully supported regarding the State/Province list. If you find a fault with your country's State/Province list, please post it in the GitHub issue tracker here: https://github.com/strangerstudios/pmpro-state-dropdowns/issues
