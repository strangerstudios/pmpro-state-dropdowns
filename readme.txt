== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I found a bug in the plugin. =

Please post it in the GitHub issue tracker here: https://github.com/strangerstudios/pmpro-state-dropdowns/issues

= I need help installing, configuring, or customizing the plugin. =

Please visit our premium support site at https://www.paidmembershipspro.com for more documentation and our support forums.

= The state fields are not showing correctly for pre-existing users =

Existing users that have entered their State/Province before using this add-on may be required to update their profile while PMPro State Dropdowns is activated. This is usually caused by incorrect spelling of the State/Province. (This only affects the front-end of your site and won't affect the previously saved user meta)

= Some States/Provinces are missing or incorrect from the State/Province dropdown =

Not all countries may be fully supported regarding the State/Province list. If you find a fault with your country's State/Province list, please post it in the GitHub issue tracker here: https://github.com/strangerstudios/pmpro-state-dropdowns/issues
